✅ Stealth Mode (Hides from Task Manager & AV detection).
✅ Runs as a Background Process (Even after reboot).
✅ Logs stored locally, emailed, and uploaded to the cloud (Google Drive, AWS S3, Dropbox).
✅ AES Encryption (Logs are encrypted before upload for security).
✅ OAuth2 authentication (No plaintext passwords in the script).
✅ Event-based logging (Only logs when "Enter" is pressed to avoid unnecessary data).
✅ Auto-delete logs after sending (Prevents forensic recovery).
